        <p>Mastodon is divided into groups, called servers, based on many topics including the UK, snooker, and security.</p>

<p>Twitter has blocked links to some of the largest servers which users would join, including the most popular "social" channel.</p>
<p>And Twitter is also stopping users from adding links to their Mastodon account in their bios - calling them "malware".</p>
<p>There is absolutely no evidence to support the suggestion that Mastodon contains malware - malicious software that can harm your device.</p>
<p>Mastodon said it gained hundreds of thousands of users in November, with some Twitter users seeking alternative platforms.</p>

            <h3>WHO calls on countries to tax sugar-sweetened beverages to save lives


</h3>
 <img src="images/ssb-sugar-image.tmb-768v.png" alt="pic">
          
          
      <div class="learn">
        <p>Today, WHO released its first-ever global tax manual for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Currently, at least 85 countries implement some type of SBB taxation.</p>
<p>The WHO manual highlights the experiences of countries who have successfully implemented the tax, including Mexico, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>“Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages can be a powerful tool to promote health because they save lives and prevent disease, while advancing health equity and mobilizing revenue for countries that could be used to realize universal health coverage,” said Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of Health Promotion at WHO. </p>
<p>SSB, tobacco, and alcohol taxes have proven to be cost-effective ways of preventing diseases, injuries, and premature mortality. SSB tax can also encourage companies to reformulate their products to reduce sugar content.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of SSBs, including soft drinks, flavoured milks, energy drinks, vitamin waters, fruit juices and sweetened iced teas, is associated with an increased risk of dental cavities, type 2 diabetes, weight gain and obesity in both children and adults, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</p>
